            Artificial Intelligence represents a rapidly expanding domain, with several industrial applications demonstrating its superiority over traditional techniques. Despite numerous advancements within the subfield of Machine Learning, it encounters persistent challenges, highlighting the importance of ongoing research efforts. Among its primary branches, this study delves into two categories, being Supervised and Reinforcement Learning, particularly addressing the common issue of data selection for training. The inherent variability in informational content among data points is apparent, wherein certain samples offer more valuable information to the neural network than others. However, evaluating the significance of various data points remains a non-trivial task, generating the need for a robust method to effectively prioritize samples. Drawing inspiration from Reinforcement Learning principles, this paper introduces a novel sample prioritization approach, applied to Supervised Learning scenarios, aimed at enhancing classification accuracy through strategic data navigation, while exploring the boundary between Reinforcement and Supervised Learning techniques. We provide a comprehensive description of our methodology, while revealing the identification of an optimal prioritization balance and demonstrating its beneficial impact on model performance. Although classification accuracy serves as the primary validation metric, the concept of information density-based prioritization encompasses wider applicability. Additionally, the paper investigates parallels and distinctions between Reinforcement and Supervised Learning methods, declaring that the foundational principle is equally relevant, hence completely adaptable to Supervised Learning with appropriate adjustments due to different learning frameworks.

            Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing complex
            control problems and optimization challenges. Its efficiency in maneuvering through
            nonlinear and intricate problem spaces has been showcased in a diverse set of applications.

            Unlike other Machine Learning paradigms, RL operates without predefined labels for training data,
            instead dynamically generating it during the learning phase. The workflow is conceptually
            characterized by a sequence of interactions between two entities: the learning agent and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            At each step, the agent evaluates the current state and executes a decision receiving a feedback, known as
            the reward, quantitatively measuring the impact of an action on progressing towards the optimal policy.

            Supervised Learning is using labeled datasets to iteratively adjust neural network weights through
            a loss function and train the network for data classification (sorting data into predefined categories)
            or regression (predicting relationships between variables). It enables machines to learn from past data
            for future predictions or decisions.

            Deep Learning has greatly advanced computer vision, enabling machines to process and understand
            images and videos. It uses deep neural networks to learn identify patterns on images, allowing
            our models to perform tasks like recognizing objects, detecting faces, and understanding
            scenes with high accuracy. Deep learning's ability to identify patterns and features at
            different levels, from simple edges to complex shapes, makes it essential for tasks requiring
            visual recognition.

      <h2 class="title is-3">Our Concept</h2>
      <p>
        In the domain of Reinforcement Learning, effective sample prioritization is essential, but often relies on
        stochastic sampling methods, resulting in suboptimal efficiency. Our paper introduces a novel approach
        integrating RL insights into Supervised Learning, aiming  to bridge this efficiency gap. To mitigate the risk of
        overfitting, we employ a dual-component priority metric, ensuring a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The workflow of our method commences by establishing a uniform probability distribution for stochastic sampling
        over the training dataset. Subsequent steps involve loss computation, model fitting and the acquisition
        of exploration and exploitation metrics, respectively. We then compute individual sample weights, also referred
        to as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) values, based on these metrics. These weights are utilized afterwards to
        update the probability distribution, prioritizing samples with higher information density.

            Through a comprehensive experimentation in the field of image classification, employing benchmark datasets
            and widely recognized neural network architectures, we validate the superior performance of our proposed
            methodology. Based on the gathered results, we can conclude, that our approach offers an efficient process
            for sample prioritization, thereby enhancing sampling efficiency and ultimately improving model performance.

            In our study, we applied the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm to visualize the CIFAR10
            dataset, representing its ten classes with different colors. Notably, we incorporated the frequency of each
            sample's utilization in model training as an additional dimension in our visualization. Larger points
            indicate samples, that were more frequently used during training. This visualization provides valuable
            insights into how prioritization strategies influence the learning process, complementing our quantitative
            analyses.
